TECH STACK- HTML,CSS,JavaScript  (Concept- API fetch, objects in js)

About project 
-I have made an imdb clone using HTML,CSS,JavaScript in which i have used the concept of **fetch** the data from apis with the help of JS. Moreover, i have added features like - full movie details and poster of movie searched.

-added media queries via CSS to make the website responsive-desktop and small screen view.

-Added event listener to the input box as well as event listener to detect click on the whole document for deleting/checking/adding the task.

- Things learned from errors - i was calling fetch on the http(..) while i need to call on https because the API i was trying to use is available under https that is the secured-http. while debugging i got the MIXED-CONTENT error.
